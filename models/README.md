this folder contains our pretrained models, the files are named with the following convention

modelname_datasetname_foldnumber.pth

we will provide all pretrained models for the 1) all-conv U-Nets (880k params), 2) global FC-U-Net (>14M params)
3) original OBELISK (120k params) and 4) Hybrid OBELISK-CNN (230k params) 
Note that currently not all models are trained with pytorch v1 and therefore slight inconsistencies may occur
